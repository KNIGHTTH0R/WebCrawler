It's working for the 1%, not the 99% of us. We need decent benefits, we need to make the minimum wage a living wage, and we need to insure that privatisation doesn't keep costing us an absolute fortune."What we need is for multinational companies, rich individuals, to be paying their taxes, which they're simply not doing at the moment."Appearing on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Ms Bennett acknowledged that the Greens were "identified with" campaigns against the extraction of shale gas, or fracking.It was a "very uncertain industry that may very well not get off the ground", she added, and there is "massive and growing public resistance to it" with her party on the "front line" of protests against fracking.She also criticised the government's immigration policy for "cutting our nose off to spite our face"."This year, for the first time, the number of foreign students applying to British universities has gone down, and that's a huge cost that has come from our immigration policy."And she said the Greens aimed to position themselves as the "anti-UKIP party"."UKIP is the party of fear, saying, 'Be fearful, vote for us,'" she explained."We're saying, 'Hope for a better society, a society that works for the common good,' so vote Green for that."Last week, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage said there would be "an earthquake" in politics if he triumphed in the European elections.Launching his party's manifesto in Sheffield, Mr Farage said: "We want to have, post-EU, a sensible, open immigration policy that says we welcome people, but we have got to control the quantity and the quality of who comes to Britain."
