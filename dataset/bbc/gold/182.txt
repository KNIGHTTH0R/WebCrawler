More than two centuries after its signing, his handwriting is instantly recognisable and his name has even become slang to describe any signature.A new exhibition at the National Archives in Washington explores the stories behind the famous and little known signatures that have made their mark on history.But electronic methods of communicating - email, Twitter, Facebook - have more or less replaced the need for pen and ink.

Can a text from a cell phone reveal anything about the sender? The BBC's Jane O'Brien finds out.Filmed and edited by Allen McGreevy
