A man "motivated by jealousy" stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death days after she told police she was "petrified" of him, a court has heard.Linah Keza, 29, a model, died from stab wounds to the chest at her Leyton flat while she was with her young daughter on 31 July 2013.The Old Bailey heard that Ms Keza had previously contacted both the police and social services for protection.David Gikawa, 38, of Leyton, denies a charge of murder.In his opening speech, Peter Finnigan QC, for the prosecution, said: "Linah had told him [Mr Gikawa] that their relationship was over."Ms Keza was "was seeing another man" and wanted to be "free from the fear, threats and control", he said.Mr Finnigan said Mr Gikawa had previously attacked Ms Keza, once allegedly placing a knife inside her mouth.Police were called but she did not want to go to court and the case was dropped, the jury was told.A few days before her death Ms Keza, a model, tried to obtain a non-molestation order from the court.In a witness statement she said their relationship "went downhill" when she became pregnant and he was "very controlling" and "made me lose a lot of my confidence and self-esteem".She said: "I'm petrified of him. I don't want a life of violence any more. I just want to live a safe life."Mr Finnigan said Ms Keza had also told police that the accused "carries a kitchen knife that he had sharpened".He added: "It's obvious isn't it that the systems in place failed to prevent her death."The trial continues.
