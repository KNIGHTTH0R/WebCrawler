A film in which Batman and Superman will team up with other superheroes from the DC Comics stable has been confirmed by the Warner Bros studio.It follows widespread speculation that a film about the so-called Justice League will follow the previously announced Superman vs Batman film."It will be a further expansion of this universe," said Greg Silverman, Warner Bros president of worldwide production.Zack Snyder will direct the film, the Wall Street Journal has reported.The US film-maker previously directed 2013's Superman film Man of Steel and is currently working on the Superman vs Batman film, set for release in May 2016."Superman vs Batman will lead into Justice League," Mr Silverman told the Wall Street Journal's Speakeasy blog.British actor Henry Cavill, Ben Affleck and Gal Gadot are all expected to appear in the film, playing the roles of Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman respectively.It is not yet known what other characters will feature, though Aquaman, The Flash and the Green Lantern were part of the original Justice League line-up.The superhero ensemble film had been expected following the success of Avengers Assemble, which brought together superheroes from the Marvel Comics stable.A sequel to that 2012 release is currently being filmed in the UK, with Joss Whedon directing and Robert Downey Jr reprising his role as 'Iron Man' Tony Stark.Downey Jr marked the reunion by tweeting a picture of himself and fellow cast and crew members, informally seated around a dining table in south-west London.Chris Hemsworth, Samuel L Jackson and Scarlett Johansson are among those who can be seen in the snapshot, published under the heading "Sunday afternoon in Richmond".The leafy Thameside enclave is not far from Shepperton Studios in Surrey, where Avengers: Age of Ultron began its principal photography this month.
