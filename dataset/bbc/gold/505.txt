Kraft Foods is voluntarily recalling 96,000lb (43,545kg) of its Oscar Mayer hot dogs in the US because they may have been sold in the wrong packaging.The US food safety authority said Kraft's Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners may mistakenly contain Classic Cheese Dogs instead.Cheese sausages contain dairy products, which can cause allergic reactions.However, both Kraft and federal authorities say they have not received reports of any adverse reactions.The US Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service (USDA) said in a statement that the products were "misbranded and contained undeclared allergens"."The products were formulated with milk, a known allergen, which is not declared on the product label," it said.The USDA notice classified the recall as a "Class I" or "a health hazard situation where there is a reasonable probability that the use of the product will cause serious, adverse health consequences or death".Kraft said it was notified of the problem by a consumer on Friday and the company alerted the USDA the following day.The 16-oz sausage packages were produced in March at a plant in Columbia, Missouri and distributed throughout the US.This is not the first time that Kraft - one of North America's biggest packaged foods companies - has been forced to pull products off the shelves.More than 1,000,000lb of its Velveeta Cheesy Skillets were recalled in January because of improper labelling.The USDA said the labels for the packaged pasta and ground beef products did not disclose that they contained known soy allergens.Last year, Kraft also recalled millions of packages of its string cheese products following complaints they would discolour and spoil before the "Best When Used By" dates on their packaging.
