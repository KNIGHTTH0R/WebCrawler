Oil giant BP has reported profits of $3.22bn (Â£1.92bn) for the first quarter of 2014.The figure is a fall of 23% on the $4.22bn for the same period in 2013, but that quarter included a $12.5bn gain from BP's sale of its stake in Russian venture TNK-BP.BP's latest profit figure, which strips out the effect of oil price movements, was ahead of forecasts.The company also said it would increase its dividend by 8%.It said it would pay 9.75 cents a share - the second dividend increase in six months.BP said its first quarter results had been affected by write-offs in its exploration activity, as well as lower production, which it said would edge lower in the second quarter.On Monday the firm said it would not sever its ties with Russian firm Rosneft, in which it owns a 20% stake, despite Rosneft's chief executive being the target of another round of US sanctions.Igor Sechin is on a list of individuals thought to be in Vladimir Putin's "inner circle", whose assets will be blocked in the US, following Russia's intervention in Crimea and Ukraine.But BP said it would continue to work with the company, despite the sanctions, which prevent US companies from engaging with those named.Mr Sechin has said sanctions imposed on him will not affect Rosneft.
