An equal number of guides ascend the slope to help foreign mountaineers, often preparing the way by fixing ropes and setting up camp.This accident comes during the peak climbing months of April and May as hundreds of climbers converged at base camp in the hope of scaling the summit.Please turn on JavaScript.
