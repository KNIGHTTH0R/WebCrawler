Tipped workers, such as waiters and bartenders, are paid on a different standard, the so-called "tipped minimum wage".In New Jersey, restaurant owners are required to pay a minimum of $2.13, with customers' tips providing the rest.While an increase in the minimum wage is currently discussed and championed by President Barack Obama, the tipped minimum wage is not part of the deal.
