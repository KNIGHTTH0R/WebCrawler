And the birds that had been made to build their nests with the floppy string immediately opted for the more rigid building material."There's a massive diversity of nests in the natural world," said Dr Bailey. "Some really amazing things - birds stitching leaves together, weaver birds building hanging baskets."And because birds are not considered to be as clever as people, who can learn to use different materials quite easily, the assumption had been that there was a genetic template in the birds' brains."This shows that actually learning is also very important for their decisions."Mike Toms from the British Trust for Ornithology said the research made a lot of sense."It may help to explain the variety of materials that may be used by individuals of the same species nesting in the same general area," he told BBC News."This new knowledge certainly increases my respect for the construction skills of birds like the long-tailed tit, which use many thousands of pieces of material to make their domed nest of moss, lichen, spider-webs and feathers."
