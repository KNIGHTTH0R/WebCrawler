He saw a vulnerable person and took advantage of somebody who was a child."And it was awful, it was a nightmare and it had huge implications for me as a young person."She said she was "blown away" when he told her she "could be the UK version" of Jodie Foster, and felt unable to say no when he asked her to take off her top and bra.He forced her to perform oral sex on him and indecently assaulted her.Decades later, the victim wrote Clifford an anonymous letter, which police found in his bedside table when they searched his home.In the letter she accused Clifford of taking pleasure in degrading her, giving him an "A+ in grooming children".After the trial, she told the BBC she still shuddered and felt ill when she thought about Clifford and that it had been sickening to see him "create a persona of a respectable, high-profile man who was lauded by the media"."I can't thank the police and the CPS enough for their endeavours to get justice for me and everyone else," she added.The second victim, an extra in the Bond film Octopussy, was targeted at Clifford's office in 1981 or 1982 when she was 19. Clifford told her actor Charles Bronson wanted pictures of her in her underwear to help him decide if she could be in a film.On the stand, Max Clifford portrayed himself as an innocent man who had been terribly wronged by the allegations of "fantasists".He denied everything, but his avowed respect for women was undermined by boasts in his biography about getting a random woman off the street to strip for photos in his office for a bet, and calling others with a fake voice to suggest they had sex with his friends.There were two Max Cliffords presented to the jury. The prosecution portrayed him as a manipulative sexual bully who drew in vulnerable young women and girls to abuse.His defence painted a picture of a respectable businessman with an appetite for innocent fun, a deep love for his family and tireless work for charity.Max Clifford did all he could to reinforce that impression, but in the end he could not convince the jury that he had nothing to hide.She said she spoke to a man claiming to be Mr Bronson on the phone, then Clifford pinned her down on a sofa but she fought him off and left.Another girl, a teenage model, said Clifford groped her when she went to his office for career advice in 1983, bragging that he could get her a part in a James Bond film.She was told to pose in her underwear and described how Clifford tried to force her to perform oral sex.The victims also included a dancer who received a phone call while she was at a nightclub from someone pretending to represent producer Broccoli and was told to find out whether Clifford was circumcised.She said she feared she would be raped when Clifford took her into the toilet and assaulted her.Clifford repeatedly denied the claims, calling his arrest and prosecution "a nightmare" and branding his accusers "fantasists".Clifford was a key player in the British media in the 1990s and 2000s, orchestrating tabloid revelations about the sex lives of politicians, including David Mellor and John Prescott, sporting figures such as David Beckham and Sven-Goran Eriksson, and actors including Jude Law.Speaking outside court, Jenny Hopkins, deputy chief crown prosecutor for CPS London, said the verdicts had provided "a long-denied justice".She said the CPS would now consider its position on the verdict the jury was unable to come to a decision on."I would like to thank these victims for having had the courage to come forward and give evidence."The victims of sexual abuse, whenever it may have taken place, should know that police and prosecutors will listen", she said.DCI Michael Orchard, from the Metropolitan Police, also paid tribute to Clifford's victims, saying he hoped they felt they were "listened to".Peter Watt, director of National Services at the NSPCC, said Clifford had been "unmasked as a ruthless and manipulative sex offender who preyed for decades on children and young women"."Clifford was a rich and influential man who dined with the stars but the way he manipulated and groomed his victims is typical of many sex offenders."He exploited their vulnerabilities, using lies and coercion to get what he wanted," he said.Please turn on JavaScript.
