A lawyer representing victims of sex offences has said the conviction of Max Clifford proves Operation Yewtree is not a "celebrity witch-hunt".On Monday publicist Clifford was found guilty of eight indecent assaults on women and girls as young as 15.Liz Dux, who represents over 150 complainants in the Yewtree inquiry, said the conviction would give others "confidence to come forward".And she said Clifford's conviction had "nothing to do with his status".Operation Yewtree is a national police investigation which was prompted by sex abuse claims against the late DJ and TV presenter Jimmy Savile.Ms Dux said Clifford's conviction was "very significant"."Firstly it shows that Operation Yewtree is not just about a celebrity witch-hunt," she said."Secondly, it's vital to give confidence to other victims that a conviction can be achieved so many years after an event without DNA or other types of scientific corroboratory evidence."She said it was right that people accused of sexual offences could be publicly named, as it could give other victims the "confidence to come forward"."It is more important that suspects like Clifford, who has been found guilty of serious sexual offences, are rightly tried for them and that other people come forward than, I'm afraid, protecting their names."Clifford, 71, from Surrey, was convicted at Southwark Crown Court for offences which took place over nearly 20 years.He was cleared of two counts of indecent assault, while the jury failed to reach a verdict on one count of the same offence.Releasing him on bail to be sentenced on Friday, Judge Anthony Leonard QC warned him the fact he was granted bail was no indication of the sentence that would be passed.Outside court Clifford said: "I have been told by my lawyers to say nothing at all."
