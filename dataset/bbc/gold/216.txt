"He can have peace with Israel or a pact with Hamas - he can't have both," he told me.Palestinian sources have told me they will only talk again if Israel agrees to preconditions - including a cessation of building in Jewish settlements across the occupied territories they want for a future state - including East Jerusalem.Both sides are demanding concessions from the other side that they are unlikely to get. If both Israel and the Palestinians stick to their positions it will mean that the nine months of talks brokered by the Americans have failed.Mr Netanyahu told the BBC's Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen that Mr Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority and leader of Fatah, could "have peace with Israel or a pact with Hamas - he can't have both".He said Israel would only resume peace talks with Palestinians "when they decide to abandon the course of terror"."As long as I'm prime minister of Israel, I will never negotiate with a Palestinian government that is backed by Hamas terrorists that are calling for our liquidation," he added.The chief Palestinian peace negotiator, Saeb Erekat, insisted that Palestinian reconciliation was an internal matter."Israel had no right to interfere in this issue," he told the Associated Press.The prime minister of the Hamas-led government in Gaza, Ismail Haniya, meanwhile said he was not surprised by Mr Netanyahu's decision."The Israeli position was expected. This is occupation, and absolutely they do not want the Palestinian people to be united and want the division to continue," he explained.Earlier, President Abbas said there was "no incompatibility between reconciliation and the talks" and that he was committed to peace on the basis of a two-state solution.Please turn on JavaScript.

Mr Abbas took the step because Israel was refusing to release a fourth group of 26 long-term Palestinian prisoners. Israel had made such a release contingent on progress in the peace talks.A senior US official said the White House would be forced to reconsider its assistance to the Palestinians if Hamas and Fatah formed an administration."Any Palestinian government must unambiguously and explicitly commit to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations between the parties," the official told the Reuters news agency.
