Three aid workers are among 22 people killed in a rebel attack on a clinic in northern Central African Republic, officials have said.Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) has condemned the killing of three of its local staff and says it is re-examining its operations.Fifteen of the dead were local chiefs, according to the area's former MP.The attack has been blamed on the mainly Muslim Seleka rebels, whose 2013 seizure of power sparked the crisis.They were accused of numerous attacks on members of the CAR's Christian majority and since their leader was forced to step down as president in January, militias have been taking revenge against the Muslim community.Please turn on JavaScript.
