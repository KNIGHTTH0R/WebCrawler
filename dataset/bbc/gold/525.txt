The US has imposed sanctions on seven Russian individuals and 17 companies it says are linked to President Vladimir Putin's "inner circle".The White House said the move was a response to "Russia's continued illegal intervention in Ukraine".Those targeted include Igor Sechin, head of oil giant Rosneft, and Sergei Chemezov of the hi-tech firm Rostec.The announcement comes after the mayor of Kharkiv, a city in eastern Ukraine, was shot and critically wounded.The most eye-catching name on the new sanctions list is one of the hard men of Russian politics, Igor Sechin. A former intelligence officer, and once President Putin's closest ally in the Kremlin, he now runs Rosneft - the huge state-controlled oil company.Alexei Pushkov, who heads the Russian parliament's foreign affairs committee and often speaks for the Kremlin to English-language broadcasters is also on the list, as are the deputy prime minister who was in charge of the Sochi Winter Olympics and the head of the Kremlin bodyguards.Seventeen Russian companies face new sanctions, too. All are linked either to President Putin's childhood friends and judo partners Arkady and Boris Rotenberg or to another close friend and billionaire Gennady Timchenko - or to Bank Rossiya, which the US government claims is the personal bank for senior Russian officials.Hennadiy Kernes was recovering after an operation to repair damage to the chest and abdomen, but his life remained in danger, his office said.Mr Kernes used to be a supporter of former pro-Moscow President Viktor Yanukovych. He then dropped his support for Mr Yanukovych in favour of a united Ukraine.Monday also saw pro-Russian separatists seize a local government building in Kostyantynivka, a town in the eastern Donetsk region.In Donetsk itself, pro-Russian activists armed with clubs and chains attacked a pro-unity rally. A number of people were injured in the clash.Western countries accuse Russia of actively supporting the activists in Eastern Ukraine - a claim denied by Moscow.Separatists were also continuing to detain about 40 people in the town of Sloviansk, including journalists, pro-Kiev activists and seven military observers linked to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) as well as three members of Ukraine's security service, officials in Kiev said.At an OSCE meeting in Vienna, Russian ambassador Andrei Kelin said Moscow was taking "steps" to secure the observers' release. But the area around Sloviansk was very tense and it had been "extremely irresponsible" to send them there, he added.UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon later called for the immediate and unconditional release of the observers.Please turn on JavaScript.
