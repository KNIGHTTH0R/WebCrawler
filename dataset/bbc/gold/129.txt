Washington says it has deployed the extra troops to reassure Nato allies.Mr Shoigu announced that Russian troops had returned to their "permanent positions" after conducting military exercises on the border with Ukraine.But he did not say whether the overall number of Russian troops deployed in the region - said to be around 40,000 - had been reduced.The Pentagon said Mr Shoigu had given "assurances that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukraine".It said Mr Hagel had warned that Russia's continued aggression would result in more diplomatic and economic pressure.He also called on Moscow to help secure the release of the seven military observers linked to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe who were seized by pro-Russian gunmen in Sloviansk last week.Some 40 people, including journalists, pro-Kiev activists and three members of Ukraine's security service are being held there.The Russian ambassador to the OSCE, Andrei Kelin, earlier said Moscow was taking "steps" to secure the observers' release.The US and EU first imposed visa bans and asset freezes on a number of senior Russian officials and companies after Moscow annexed Crimea from Ukraine last month.Please turn on JavaScript.
