A row has broken out over a council's decision to propose a pay freeze for all staff other than the lowest paid.Bridgend council says it will save £1m and help protect jobs and services.It is the only authority out of the 22 in Wales which has not negotiated pay rises with unions as part of the National Joint Council for Local Government Services.The council, which needs to save £36m in the next few years, currently spends 68% of its £225m budget on wages.Please turn on JavaScript.
