She was later pronounced dead.At a school well regarded by the pupils milling around outside, it seems none of them can quite believe the tragic events that unfolded.A student sits on the pavement in tears while others cautiously approach to lay the first of what is likely to be many floral tributes at the gates of Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds.A distraught woman stands at the roadside, inconsolable at the loss of the teacher she called a friend.Talking to those gathered at the Neville Road school, 17-year-old Aine Arnold summed up the feeling amongst her peers."She was lovely, I can't believe that anyone wanted to do something so horrible."The 15-year-old was detained by teaching staff and later arrested.A pupil at the scene told the BBC that children were seen screaming and running from a classroom following the attack.Ch Supt Paul Money of West Yorkshire Police said the victim received a number of stab wounds and a knife was recovered from the scene."The incident itself was over very quickly and no other pupils or staff were threatened or injured. However this has clearly been a very traumatic situation for those involved," Mr Money said.He said the attack was an "unprecedented event" and schools in Leeds were "generally very safe places" to work and study.Staff members were "in shock" and Mrs Maguire's death would "understandably have a massive impact" on her family and the school, he added.Downing Street said the prime minister's thoughts were with the victim's family.The BBC's education correspondent Sean Coughlan said the incident would bring back memories of Philip Lawrence, a head teacher who was killed outside a school in Maida Vale, London, in 1995.Please turn on JavaScript.

Our thoughts and prayers are with the family."Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers (NUT), said the fatal stabbing was "a truly awful thing to have happened to a teacher in the course of her work to educate the next generation"."Appalling events like this are thankfully very rare indeed but the death of any teacher in her place of work, which should be a place of safety, is devastating."Our condolences go to the family and friends of this teacher, and to students and colleagues at the school."She said the NUT would provide help and assistance to the college and its community.Hilary Benn, MP for Leeds Central, the constituency in which the college is located, said the killing was "profoundly saddening"."It is not representative of the college or the community that surrounds it," he said.While "shocking, terrible" attacks like this were rare, that would be "no comfort" to the dead teacher's family, Mr Benn added.Pupils have been paying tribute to the teacher on Twitter.One said Mrs Maguire had "made our Year 11 best time of our life, what an amazing woman RIP".Another said: "I actually feel sick... RIP to probably the best teacher ever."Are you in the area? Do you have any information you would be willing to share with the BBC?
