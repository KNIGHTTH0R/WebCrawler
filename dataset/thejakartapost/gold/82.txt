Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Agus Martowardojo warned on Thursday that uncertainty over the US Federal Reserve's interest policy would  pose risks to the Indonesian economy. "From the global front, the risks include impact from the Fed‘s policy, economic growth that is not as high as we expect and high vulnerability of emerging economies to external volatility," said Agus during a presentation at the central bank headquarters in Central Jakarta. The Jakarta Composite Index fell 2.5 percent while the rupiah retreated the most in three months versus the dollar as it dropped by 1 percent after the Fed signaled a faster timetable for raising interest rates. "We will respond accordingly to the Fed’s signal with a set of policies that we are now preparing," said Agus, without going into details.
