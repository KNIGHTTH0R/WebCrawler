Outspoken Deputy Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama has apologized to former deputy governor Prijanto after he apparently offended his predecessor in a statement, insinuating that Prijanto had not been useful. The statement was made recently when Ahok was asked what he would do if Governor Joko “Jokowi” Widodo should leave City Hall to run in the presidential election. Ahok replied that he was ready to work with anyone, as long as the person was committed to the people. “I can work with anyone willing to work for the people. If the person does not want to cooperate, we can just ‘Prijanto’ him,” Ahok said, referring to a period when the relationship between Prijanto and former Jakarta governor Fauzi Bowo soured, and Prijanto was sidelined and given no significant involvement in City Hall. Ahok’s statement triggered a reaction from Prijanto, who is a retired Army general. “I immediately called Ahok. What did he mean by that statement?” Prijanto said on Sunday as quoted by kompas.com. “He made a statement implying that I didn’t work for the people. He thought he was like Fauzi Bowo, so whoever works with the deputy governor [...] should be ‘Prijanto-ed’,” he said. Prijanto also asked Ahok to take down all the news reports quoting his statement. Ahok said on Monday that he had apologized to the former governor.
