Guus Hiddink will take over as Netherlands coach after the World Cup, when Louis van Gaal is stepping down, the country’s soccer association announced on Friday.Hiddink will lead the Netherlands until the end of the 2016 European Championship in France and then be replaced by Danny Blind.Blind and former Manchester United and Real Madrid striker Ruud van Nistelrooy were appointed as 67-year-old Hiddink’s assistants.Hiddink said he was honored to return for a second stint in charge after he led a talented young Dutch team to the World Cup semifinals in France in 1998, when it lost on penalties to Brazil.“With Danny Blind and Ruud van Nistelrooy, we have a strong team with a huge amount of football knowledge and experience,” Hiddink said in a statement. “It is also a fantastic chance for me to prepare my own successors. In this way, the football vision of the Netherlands team can be preserved for the long term.”
