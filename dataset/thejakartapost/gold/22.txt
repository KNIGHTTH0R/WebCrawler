Army Chief of Staff Gen. Budiman said that he intended to dismiss a soldier who was involved in political activities and therefore jeopardized the Indonesian Military (TNI)’s pledge to maintain neutrality.“We have identified a private, who has failed to maintain neutrality. Therefore, I will have no choice but to discharge him,” Budiman said without revealing the private’s true identity. Antara news wire reported on Friday.Budiman had earlier mentioned that he and other military leaders would not tolerate any actions that jeopardized TNI's political neutrality.(put/dic)
