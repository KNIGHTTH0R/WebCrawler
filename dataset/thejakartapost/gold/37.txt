The administration plans to relocate social rehabilitation centers for beggars, vagrants and sex workers to Tangerang in an attempt to prevent them from returning to the capital city.Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama said at City Hall on Friday that the administration had acquired 100 hectares of land in Ciangir, Tangerang, Banten, where new shelters would be built to accommodate illegal beggars, vagrants and sex workers. “All the shelters will be pooled there. Those people with social problems will be accommodated and given skills training before being returned to their home villages,” he said.Ahok said the new centers would be far from the capital city so that people with social problems would find it difficult to return to the city.
