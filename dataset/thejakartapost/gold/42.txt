Dozens of people grouped under a civil society network for the release of Satinah, an Indonesian migrant worker facing the death penalty for allegedly killing her employer in Saudi Arabia, staged a rally in Semarang, Central Java, on Friday, demanding the provincial administration to pay the blood money to free her from the kingdom.They urged the administration to allocate funds from the provincial budget to cover the shortfall of the blood money, known as diyat, of Rp 9 billion (US$794,000) to avoid Satinah being beheaded.“The administration must make a concrete move, not just open a donation account for Satinah,” protester coordinator Dian Puspitasari said.The protesters also urged President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to take serious measures to save Satinah from execution, scheduled for April 3. She is convicted of murdering her female employer, Nura al-Gharib.In her defense, Satinah, who claimed to have been treated badly while working there, said that on Sept. 18, 2007 her employer grabbed her hair and banged her head against the wall.Separately, Central Java Governor Ganjar Pranowo said he would try to raise funds from legislative candidates contesting in the province.“We have 17,000 legislative candidates here. If a candidate donates Rp 1 million, we will be able to collect Rp 17 billion. The number is more than enough to cover the blood money,” Ganjar said.
