The provincial authorities in Aceh are working extremely hard to boost the tourist industry in the province, for example by organizing a recent surfing competition. If those in government in Aceh want to do so, the first thing that the authorities should do is scrap sharia (Islamic law). No tourists want to visit Aceh, especially female tourists, if they cannot sunbathe in bathing suits on Aceh’s many beautiful beaches. What did the female surfers wear when they were competing in the surfing competition? I have lived in Aceh too, since my husband worked there for five years shortly after the tsunami. One day, I was asked to leave the premises of a mosque in Banda Aceh when I was filming the beautiful building with my camera, because I was wearing Bermuda shorts and a T-shirt. With all due respect to the people of Aceh and the Acehnese authorities, why are you so surprised that few tourists visit your province? Female European, American, Japanese and Chinese tourists prefer to wear shorts and T-shirts or tank tops because they suffer from Indonesia’s extreme heat — Indonesia is a tropical country after all. With your sharia, you keep tourists away; they prefer to go to Bali, Yogyakarta, Medan, Lampung, Makassar, Manado, Kalimantan, Papua and East Nusa Tenggara (NTT) for holidays. Wake up Aceh, you are the only province in Indonesia with sharia. Get rid of it and many tourists will automatically come to visit and enjoy your beautiful province, sunbathe on your white sandy beaches and most of all taste your world-famous kopi luwak (civet coffee).
