Deputy Public Works Minister Hermanto Dardak officially launched on Thursday a renovation program at the Pluit drainage pump station.The project will be carried out with a 1.6 billion yen (US$15.6 million) grant from the Japanese government.Also attending the officiating ceremony were Governor Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, Japan’s deputy foreign minister, Nario Mitsuya, and Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia Yoshinori Katori The Japanese Embassy said in a statement released on Friday that the Japanese government had offered the grant because Jakarta was a capital city that had recently experienced flooding, caused by the increasing population and climate change. As a consequence, the pump station at Pluit Reservoir in North Jakarta had also malfunctioned due to reduced land surface in the city.The embassy added that the grant would restore the pump station’s function, namely to pump out water from 34 square kilometers in Central Jakarta and thereby mitigate floods in the city.
