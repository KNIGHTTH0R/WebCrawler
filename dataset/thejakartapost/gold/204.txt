Amid the public outcry over the haze in Riau, it is absolutely unwise of the government to try to play a blame game. Those in government should focus on how to anticipate the possible worsening of the haze in the coming days and try to stop it happening next year. It is amazing that such a man-made disaster occurs every year, polluting the air of Riau province and even our neighboring countries — Singapore and Malaysia. Unfortunately, it will happen again next year if the government does not prevent individual farmers and corporations from burning forests to clear land as part of their preparations to develop rubber and oil-palm plantations. Their slash-and-burn practices cause serious problems when they cannot control the fires due to the strong winds and dry conditions in the province. The fires cannot easily be extinguished when they happen in peatland areas. It is good that the local police have started to arrest dozens of suspected arsonists and intend to prosecute the companies allegedly responsible for the disaster, which caused hundreds of thousands to suffer from respiratory problems. Hopefully tough actions will deter others from conducting similar stupidity next year. It is regrettable that both government and the people never learn from the previous year’s forest fires, proven in the way it happens again and again. From now on, the government should be tough against the companies that burn the forests. The government also needs to cooperate with neighboring countries on preventative efforts, including ratifying the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution. This agreement emphasizes the importance of international cooperation in mitigating transboundary haze pollution, particularly with Malaysia and Singapore. In conclusion, don’t let the haze appear again next year. Fajar Erlangga Depok, West Java
