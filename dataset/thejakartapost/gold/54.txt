March 20, Online/AP US President Barack Obama on Thursday expanded US economic sanctions against Moscow over its actions in Ukraine, targeting Russia President Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff and 19 other individuals as well as a Russian bank that provides them support. Obama, warning of more costs to come for the Kremlin if the situation worsens, said he also signed an executive order that would allow the US to penalize key sectors of the Russian economy. Officials said Obama could act on that authority if Russian forces press into other areas of Ukraine, an escalation of the crisis in Crimea. Your comments: Russia has succeeded in taking over Crimea and there does not appear to be any possibility that it will be handed it back to Ukraine. There is some doubt that Russia intends to take over other areas because it would have already orchestrated unrest with Russian speakers in those districts, leading to a need for Russian intervention to protect the people. The mere threat of intervention in the other districts provides face saving for all parties. The Russians keep the Crimea, Ukraine keeps the other districts, so everyone feels they have accomplished something. Since the end of World War II there has been a tendency to see national borders as sacrosanct. The breakup of states such as Yugoslavia of course partly eroded that position. However, Russian actions significantly undermine sacrosanct borders. Historically of course, national borders were never permanent but reflected counter balancing forces at any given time. The Asia Pacific is experiencing disputes over borders. Two protagonists are China and Timor Leste, both of which are in dispute with other nations over borders.   The lesson from Putin is that the best way to guarantee a border is by force, not negotiation.
