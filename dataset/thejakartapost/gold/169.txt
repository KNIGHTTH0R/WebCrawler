March 28, Online Jakarta Deputy Governor Basuki “Ahok” Tjahaja Purnama criticized bureaucrats at City Hall for having lavish, excessive offices during an impromptu visit to various agencies and working units in the building on Thursday. Ahok, who first visited the office of the absent regional secretary on the fourth floor, said the office was more luxurious than his and Governor Joko “Jokowi” Widodo’s. The acting regional secretary is Wiriyatmoko, who was recently in an altercation with Ahok over red tape faced by companies donating city buses. Ahok said on Tuesday he would fire Wiriyatmoko if he became governor. Your comments: Ahok is doing the right thing — these lazy city officials must be sacked if they do not perform! Don’t be too kind to these people — they have been milking the treasury and living off the government for too long, aside from being corrupt. As for luxurious offices like Wiriyatmoko’s, they are lavishly renovated and furnished for ultra-comfort because of the one hour naps after lunch and for the entire month of Ramadan. Imagine a pure leather reclining sofa in an office with air-conditioning at 22 degrees... heaven on earth! Malam Continue your change of Jakarta, Mr. Ahok. It is refreshing to see a new breed of real politicians, unlike the 99.91 percent of other politicians and government employees that do as little as possible or are downright evil with dark intentions. I think leaving Jakarta in your hands may have many positive effects for Jakarta. With Jokowi as President and you as the governor of Jakarta you could change a lot of things. Those that oppose your concepts support corruption, idiocy and laziness. Deddy K
