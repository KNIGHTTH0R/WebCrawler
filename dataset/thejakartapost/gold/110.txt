The Indonesian embassy in Kuala Lumpur has expressed disappointment over an article titled “Is MH370 being hidden at U.S. base in Diego Garcia?”, printed by the Utusan Malaysia daily newspaper on March 17.The article highlighted speculation that had earlier been published by U.S.-based portal Cabal Times saying that the missing plane had likely crossed Indonesia, which should have been captured by Indonesian military radar.The same article also suggested that the Indonesian government had covered up information regarding the fact that the missing plane had crossed its territory.Commenting on the allegations, the embassy stated that Indonesia did not have any particular agenda and was not involved in any conspiracy.“The article gives mere speculation with no supporting data and thus will only create confusion among the public, moreover for the family of the missing plane victims,” the embassy said in a written statement sent to The Jakarta Post on Tuesday.
