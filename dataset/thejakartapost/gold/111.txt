Supporters of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) should just focus on helping the party achieve a landslide victory in the upcoming legislative election, newly appointed presidential candidate, Joko “Jokowi” Widodo, said on Sunday.“It is a hard task, but we all have to concentrate on winning the April 9 legislative election,” urged Jokowi to his crowd of admirers on the first day of the open campaign season in Jakarta at Cendrawasih Stadium in Cengkareng, West Jakarta.Jokowi emphasized that this year’s legislative election would be crucial for the party and that it would help make the presidential campaign easier to maneuver.“We have waited 10 years for this chance, so let’s paint Indonesia red,” he exclaimed, adding that those who came should urge neighbors and family to cast their votes this year.Jokowi also stated that apart from voting, people should play their role as witnesses to the democratic process, in order to deter any bad intentions.“It seems that there are people who wish to cheat. So keep your eyes peeled and watch over the vote-counting process,” he said on stage, while accompanied by the party’s secretary-general, Tjahjo Kumolo, and House of Representatives candidate Effendi Muara Sakti Simbolon.The event was greeted positively by thousands of people, especially with Jokowi making an appearance. However, not everyone thinks that open campaigns are effective.Saeful Huda, a taxi driver who supports Jokowi, said that these campaigns have lost their meaning and are only a nuisance to residents.“The media fills the position so well that I don't think these campaigns are relevant anymore," he said.Mariati, a local resident, came to Cendrawasih Stadium because a legislative candidate urged her to attend, said that only 50 percent of the attendees were true party supporters.
