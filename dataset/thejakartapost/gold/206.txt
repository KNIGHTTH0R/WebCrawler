March 23, Online Cigarette manufacturers will be required to put pictorial warnings about the dangers of smoking on the front and back of cigarette packets starting June 24. The inclusion of pictorial health warnings on cigarette packets is stipulated in Government Regulation (PP) No. 109/2012 on tobacco control. Your comments: The experience in Australia suggests that destroying “glamorous” packaging by putting images of death on the packages does have an effect that enhances the quit rate. The removal of brand identification (i.e. plain packaging), which was greatly resisted by the tobacco companies, along with the deathly imagery has been a successful strategy. It removes part of the marketing. Mind you, this is at the end of the whole process of removing advertising on TV and in public spaces and from sports (here, band sponsorship) advertising. That link is yet to be broken here. It is a strategy that takes time. But all smoke is dangerous, so how to stop people burning plastic and garbage in the drains? It is a good start. Then to increase the tax on each pack sold by 1 percent per year with all money collected to go straight into the new health insurance scheme. John Elliott Publishing this kind of story in your media is a valuable public service. Thank you. Illnesses and deaths due to cigarette smoking are a preventable medical or health disaster. The responsible thing for a media organization such as The Jakarta Post to do is present the risks and dangers of cigarette smoking. Efforts to increase awareness via pictorial health warnings, or any other similar informative efforts are still better than a total ban. James Waworoendeng We must also apply a pollution tax for cigarettes sold in Jakarta. Use the proceeds to pay for the health care of non-smokers who suffer health problems caused by the smokers.
