The Attorney Generalâ€™s Office (AGO) has named two officials from the Jakarta Transportation Agency as suspects in connection with the procurement of faulty buses from China, worth Rp 1 trillion (US$88 million).AGO spokesman Setia Untung Arimuladi said in a press conference on Friday that the two officials, identified by their initials DA and ST, were named as suspects after the AGO found adequate initial evidence in the case.DA, or Drajat Adhyaksa, was known as the authority on budget use, while ST or Setyo Tuhu was the head of the bus procurement committee."The investigators are now preparing for further investigation and gathering more evidence," Setia said.The case of the faulty buses was highlighted when pictures of damaged components on the newly arrived Chinese-made buses circulated on social media in January.It was reported that around 15 newly shipped buses -- 10 single buses and five articulated buses -- which were produced by Chinese automobile company Ankai, were allegedly not in a new condition and were not in line with the specifications of the order.The damaged components included power-steering parts, engine mounts, machine pulleys and air filters. The buses' water coolant tanks were leaky, windshields were broken, dashboard instruments were unscrewed and air conditioning units were faulty.
