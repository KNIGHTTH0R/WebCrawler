With a lively contingent of Indonesian supporters cheering them on at a packed National Indoor Arena, Birmingham, England, Hendra Setiawan/Mohammad Ahsan finally ended Indonesia’s 11 year wait for a men’s doubles All England Super Series Premier title on Sunday.The world number one pair claimed the trophy after defeating the world number two team of Hiroyuki Endo/Kenichi Hayakawa from Japan in a tight two-set game 21-19, 21-19.Indonesia last won the men’s doubles All England trophy was when veteran duo Sigit Budiarto/Chandra Wijaya clinched the title in 2003.In a match aired live by a local TV, Hendra/Ahsan raced to a 3-1 lead in the first game before Endo/Hayakawa leveled the score at 16-16. Despite finding it difficult to close out points against the Japanese pair, Hendra/Ahsan finally sealed the first game 21-19.With the score even at 2-2 early in the second game, it was clear that neither team was willing to take unnecessary risks and seemed more focused on not losing points rather than winning points. The conservative play continued right until the end of the game, where the Indonesian pair, who won the World Badminton Championship last year, finally held steady to take the game 21-19.Both Hendra and Ahsan thanked all of Indonesia for their never-ending support and dedicated the All England trophy to their country and families.
