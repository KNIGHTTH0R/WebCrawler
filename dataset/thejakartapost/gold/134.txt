Five years after a major overhaul in 2009, the train station at Tanjung Priok, North Jakarta, which was constructed during the Dutch colonial era, is in a mess once again due to a lack of care and maintenance. If a portion of the state budget was allocated to the station, which has been named a heritage building, the grandeur of its European style and lofty ceiling hall could attract tourists. Arifin and his three children were at the station recently and did not have a memorable experience. After missing the train to Surabaya, East Java, last weekend, instead of showing his children around the station while waiting for the next train, he asked them to not wander around because he was worried about the dripping ceiling. “The slippery floor is dangerous, so I don’t allow them to play around. They have to stick with me,” he said. The ticket counter at the station looks shabby and the ornamental ceiling, riddled with mold, looks like it could fall down at any moment.
