The National Police have launched investigations into five alleged campign violations that had been reported by the Elections Monitoring Agency (Bawaslu), a police official said on Friday.The allegations include the deliberate destruction of campaign paraphernalia in Bali, the use of state facilities and the involvement of subdistrict heads in campaigns in Central Java, organizing political events outside the official campaign period in Papua, and vote-buying in West Sumatra.“Bawaslu may have more [cases] in hand, but the agency has so far only reported these five cases to us,” National Police spokesman Sr. Comr. Agus Rianto said as quoted by kompas.com.The investigation process for election violations normally take less time than regular criminal investigations, which sometimes take months. The police are expected to complete their investigations within a few days to allow a panel of judges to start hearing the cases before the campaign period ends.(idb/dic)
