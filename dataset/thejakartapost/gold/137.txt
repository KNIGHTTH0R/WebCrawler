The youngest son of well-known musician Ahmad Dani, identified only as AQJ, may end up in prison following a road accident due to alleged reckless driving, which caused the death of seven people and injured nine others in September last year.East Jakarta District Court spokesman Djaniko Girsang said the maximum sentence for reckless driving resulting in death was six years. He added, however, that as AQJ was a minor at the time of the accident, the sentence may be reduced to half the time announced by the panel of judges in his trial.“AQJ will serve only half the sentence imposed by the panel because he is a minor,” Djaniko said as quoted by kompas.com on Tuesday.The court hearing was held behind closed doors due to AQJ being underage.Court was adjourned until the same day next week, presumably to hear witness testimony as AQJ's lawyer remained reluctant to present his closing statement.AQJ was speeding on the Jagorawi toll road in Cibubur while taking his girlfriend early one Sunday morning, when he lost control of his vehicle and crossed the central barrier, hitting an oncoming Daihatsu Gran Max minivan carrying 13 passengers and a Toyota Avanza SUV.Following the incident, AQJ was hospitalized for nearly four weeks and underwent five operations at the Pondok Indah Hospital, South Jakarta.
