The country’s publicly listed property developers ended 2013 with good news, as most of them reported a significant growth in their incomes during the year. Ciputra Property, part of the Ciputra Group, saw its annual net income grow by 38.5 percent to end at Rp 442.12 billion (US$38.9 million) last year. In comparison, the company earned Rp 319.15 billion in the previous year. The company’s revenues climbed more than 75 percent to reach Rp 1.45 trillion last year from Rp 826.47 billion. Condominium and residential sales accounted for 41 percent of the company’s total revenues, with Rp 589.86 billion, followed by shopping centers with Rp 351.74 billion or 24 percent of the total figure. Office and home office sales reached Rp 326.27 billion or 22.5 percent of total revenue, while hotels made about 10 percent of the sales. The company also recorded a new recurring income from office leases totaling Rp 33.52 billion. Ciputra Property director Artadinata Djangkar said the company would at least launch two new projects this year. The company’s key projects include the superblocks Ciputra World 1 and Ciputra World 2 in Jakarta. Ciputra World 1 features roughly 306 apartment units, in addition to 80 luxury apartment units, while Ciputra World 2 boasts at least two condominium buildings and serviced apartments. Ciputra Development, also part of the Ciputra Group, saw its profits grow by around 66 percent to hit Rp 1.41 trillion, compared to the Rp 849.38 billion it booked in the previous year. Ciputra Development’s revenue surged by 53 percent to Rp 5.08 trillion last year, compared to Rp 3.32 trillion the previous year.

The company booked only a slight increase in revenue, recording a total of Rp 4.9 trillion last year compared to Rp 4.69 trillion in the previous year. Sales made nearly 80 percent of the company’s total revenue, while rentals made the remaining. Revenue from rentals went up by nearly 28 percent year-on-year to Rp 1 trillion while sales stayed flat, in line with the company’s efforts to boost recurring income. “Our malls and hotels contributed 20.5 percent of total sales and revenues in 2013, compared to 16.8 percent last year. The increase in recurring revenues is mainly driven by the improved performance of our malls,” read the company’s statement on Friday said. The recurring revenue, according to the statement, came from shopping centers Central Park, Kuningan City and Emporium Pluit; from hotels such as Pullman Jakarta Central Park; and rentals from the AXA Office Tower in Kuningan City. The company recorded marketing sales of Rp 799.9 billion for January. Its Orchard Park in Batam generated marketing sales of Rp 295 billion, contributing about 37 percent of total marketing sales in January, while Podomoro City Deli in Medan, North Sumatra, contributed about 46.7 percent.
