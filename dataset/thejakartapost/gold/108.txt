Hundreds of university professors say former vice president Jusuf Kalla, a Golkar Party politician, is the most qualified candidate in the upcoming presidential election, more so than other contenders such as Jakarta Governor Joko “Jokowi” Widodo and former Constitutional Court (MK) chief justice Mahfud MD, a survey has revealed.The survey, held by Jakarta-based pollster - the Pol-Tracking Institute - between Feb. 3 and March 1, asked 330 university professors across the nation to rate the personal qualities of 35 presidential hopefuls based on seven aspects on a scale of 1 –10, with 10 being the most positive.Kalla, according to the survey, scored the highest in five aspects: vision and ideas, leadership and decisiveness, competence and capability, leadership experience and achievement, and the ability to lead a government coalition, while Jokowi lead in the categories of integrity and ability to lead the state and the government.Mahfud, meanwhile, finished second or third in each of the categories.The survey placed Kalla as the most qualified presidential candidate with an average score of 7.70, followed by Jokowi with 7.66 and Mahfud with 7.55.Hanura Party chairman Wiranto and Gerindra Party chief patron Prabowo Subianto came in fourth and fifth with an average score of 7.09 and 7.08, respectively.Only five politicians, however, managed to score higher than seven. Meanwhile Prosperous Justice Party (PKS) chairman Anis Matta, National Awakening Party (PKB) chairman Muhaimin Iskandar and Regional Representatives Council (DPD) chairman Irman Gusman were among 10 figures who scored lower than six in the survey.Pol-Tracking executive director Hanta Yuda said the study had been conducted to provide the public with an alternative view of the presidential hopefuls.“Most [election] research focuses on measuring the popularity or electability of presidential hopefuls and gives very little attention to their personal capacity, capability and quality,” he said.Hanta said university professors from various disciplines had been invited to participate in the survey as they could provide a “mature perspective and expertise” on judging the quality of presidential hopefuls.According to the Education and Culture Ministry, as of 2010 Indonesia had 4,717 professors out of a total of 197,922 university educators in the country’s 83 state universities and more than 3,000 private institutions.
