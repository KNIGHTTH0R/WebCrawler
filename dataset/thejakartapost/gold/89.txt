One of the largest property developers in Indonesia, PT Bumi Serpong Damai (BSDE), has announced that it is targeting marketing-sales growth of 11 percent to Rp 6 trillion (US$527 million) this year. It is boosting its commercial property business to meet the target. BSDE is a subsidiary of PT Sinar Mas Land, a unit under the conglomerate Sinar Mas Group. “Our marketing sales target in 2013 was Rp 5 trillion, and we ended up collecting Rp 5.4 trillion, excluding the roughly Rp 1.9 trillion one-time marketing sales we scored through our joint ventures with Aeon Mall and Hong Kong Land,” BSDE director Hermawan Wijaya said on Monday. When taking these joint ventures into consideration, the developer ended 2013 with an overall marketing sales figure of Rp 7.3 trillion, 72 percent higher than the previous year. BSDE has sold roughly 68 hectares of land to Hong Kong Land, on which the latter seeks to build premium residences. BSDE is also collaborating with a Japanese retailer, Aeon Mall, to construct the flagship mall in BSD City, BSDE’s township. “As for this year, we aim to raise our marketing sales earnings by 11 percent, to Rp 6 trillion. We consider this our conservative target,” Hermawan said. He added that 52 percent, or equivalent to Rp 3 trillion, of marketing sales this year would come from residential property. “However, the proportion contributed by residences will decline by 20 percent compared to 2013, during which residences accounted for 72 percent of marketing sales,” he pointed out.
