A loose adaptation of Marah Rusli’s 1922 book of the same title, the musical play is both visually and emotionally entertaining. The obsession of director Denny Malik, a renowned choreographer and singer, the show had a premier on Friday that left audiences astounded and amazed with the two-and-a-half hour production. This version stays close to the roots of the original tale of romance laced with greed, betrayal, anti-colonialism and a critique of tradition and education — issues that are still relevant today. The complex story was softened by every element of the production: the songs and musical arrangements; the choreography, costumes and sets; the cast, of course; and finally the use of illusions and stage tricks. Despite some glitches in the delivery of some actors and problems with sound in the Teater Jakarta playhouse at the Taman Ismail Marzuki (TIM) art center in Cikini, Central Jakarta, the performance quenched the thirst for cabarets that dominated the country’s live stages in the 1980s when performers such as Denny were on the frontline. “It has been my obsession to produce a play that is both popular and thick with Indonesian culture,” Denny said to reporters. “I hope that the play sells overseas. If they have Romeo and Juliet or Phantom of the Opera, we have Siti Nurbaya.” It took four months for the cast and crew to prepare for the show — and longer for Denny and musical arranger Otti Jamalus to set up the foundations for the play. They arranged new songs and background music to blend with traditional Minang music. The orchestra also included traditional Minang instruments.
