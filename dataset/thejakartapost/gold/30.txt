Publicly listed fashion retailers Mitra Adiperkasa (MAP) and Ramayana Lestari Sentosa saw their bottom lines deflate last year, hauled by rising costs and currency depreciation. While the country’s macroeconomic conditions did not seem to discourage consumers from shopping for brand new clothes, as reflected by higher annual sales booked by the fashion retailers last year, the unfavorable economic situation led MAP to fall short of securing year-on-year (y-o-y) profit growth. MAP, according to its full-year financial report published on Friday, saw its net profit plummet by 24.25 percent to Rp 327.79 billion (US$28.85 million) last year, from the Rp 432.75 billion it earned in the previous year. The company actually recorded a revenue increase of about 28 percent to Rp 9.73 trillion last year, compared to the Rp 7.58 trillion it generated in the previous year. Retail and wholesale sales made up about 89 percent of the lifestyle retailer’s revenue last year with Rp 8.64 trillion, followed by consignment sales commission with 10 percent. Commenting on the 2013 full-year results, MAP corporate secretary Fetty Kwartati said that “in spite of a challenging business environment, we posted our highest ever net revenue.” “But our overall performance was impacted by escalating wages and rental fees, as well as higher interest and forex [foreign exchange] rates due to the sluggish rupiah, which depreciated by 26 percent against the US dollar in 2013,” Fetty said. The company’s costs of goods sold and direct costs rose by nearly 31 percent y-o-y to stand at Rp 4.88 trillion last year. Its selling expenses, which include labor costs and electricity expenses, went up by about 32 percent to Rp 3.48 trillion last year, compared to Rp 2.63 trillion in 2012. Furthermore, MAP’s forex loss more than doubled to Rp 59.93 billion in 2013 from Rp 25.61 billion a year before. MAP’s retail network increased to 1,779 stores with the opening of 396 new stores in 2013. The company’s same-store sales growth (SSSG) — reflecting growth from already-existing chains before the financial report period — stood at 10 percent last year. Fetty said that the retailer was set to secure 18 to 20 percent sales growth this year, lower than last year’s growth, to give more time for the company to focus on “internal consolidation after seeing more than 25 percent growth annually in the last three years”. MAP, which holds licenses of popular foreign brands such as Zara, Topshop and Marks&Spencer, focuses on the middle- to upper-class consumers. The flopping profits were also experienced by Ramayana, which mostly targets the country’s middle- to lower-class segment. Ramayana booked relatively stagnant revenue growth, up from Rp 5.7 trillion in 2012 to Rp 6 trillion last year. The retailer’s net profit was down by nearly 8 percent to Rp 390.53 billion last year, from Rp 423.74 billion in the previous year. Ramayana spokesman Setyadi Surya said that last year’s inflation hike resulting from increases fuel prices had deeply impacted the company’s consumers and further slowed down their shopping appetite. “Even the slightest price change can affect our consumers [...] we really have to be extra cautious,” he said. Significant wage increases had resulted in burgeoning costs for the company, and undermined the company’s profit growth, Setyadi explained. Last year, Ramayana opened eight stores with total investment of around Rp 400 billion. MAP’s shares were traded on the Indonesia Stock Exchange under the code MAPI at Rp 6,250 on Friday, falling 4.94 percent from the previous day. Meanwhile, Ramayana’s shares (RALS) closed at Rp 1,390 on Friday, 1.07 percent lower than the previous day.
