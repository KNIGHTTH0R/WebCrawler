Indonesian Military Commander Gen. Moeldoko has indicated uncertainty as to whether he would become Joko "Jokowi" Widodo's running mate should he be offered a spot on the presidential ticket. Moeldoko's name was recently included as one of seven put forth as contenders by senior Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P) member Maruarar Sirait.“If I were to refuse the offer then everybody would call me arrogant but if I said yes, well the fact is that I am still carrying out my duty as the military commander. Therefore, I would focus my energy on the latter right now,” Moeldoko told The Jakarta Post on Thursday.When asked whether his answer would remain the same if he were asked few months from now, Moeldoko insisted that his only desire would be to continue leading the military.Moeldoko’s name has been mentioned along with former army chief of staff Gen. (ret) Ryamizard Ryacudu and former army educational and training commander Gen. (ret) Luhut Panjaitan as military men being considered by PDI-P to run as Jokowi’s VP candidate.Besides these military figures, other names like former Constitutional Court chief justice Mahfud MD, Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) chairman Abraham Samad and former VP Jusuf Kalla are also being considered.
