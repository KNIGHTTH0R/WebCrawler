The Bandung Police have raided orphanages across Bandung in West Java to track down a missing baby snatched from Hasan Sadikin General Hospital on Tuesday.The baby girl, who was to be named Valencia, was kidnapped from the hospital by a woman dressed in a paramedic’s uniform while the baby’s parents, Lasmaria Boru Manulang and Toni Manurung, were in the bathroom. Based on CCTV pictures, the perpetrator was female, had light skin and wore black-framed glasses.“We have conducted a search at eight orphanages, to no avail,” Bandung City Police chief Sr. Comr. Mashudi said on Friday. Investigators, he added, had also released a sketch of the alleged perpetrator.West Java Police chief Insp. Gen. M. Iriawan said a human trafficking network could be behind the kidnapping. “Somebody helped the perpetrator [in committing the crime],” said Iriawan without elaborating on the possible accomplices.Separately, a criminologist at Padjadjaran University, Yesmil Anwar, said the crime may have been committed by a syndicate or an individual. “The perpetrator is familiar with the hospital’s surroundings. If it was committed by a syndicate, the baby might be sold. If the perpetrator worked alone, she might take care of the baby,” Yesmil said. The Health Ministry has also deployed a team to check on the hospital’s security measures.
