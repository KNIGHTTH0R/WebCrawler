Hong Kong (CNN) -- North Korea ratchets up tensions following U.S. President Barack Obama's visit to the region by starting a live-fire drill near its western sea border.South Korean semi-official Yonhap news agency reported Tuesday that North Korea had notified South Korea's Navy's Second Fleet that it was preparing for live-fire exercises near the border. The live-fire drill comes amid a number of other belligerent North Korean moves.Late last week South Korean officials reported that North Korea had completed the steps needed to conduct a nuclear test, including the sealing of a tunnel at the Punggye-ri site in northeastern North Korea, which analysts say is the final preparation for testing a device.The North Korean analyst website 38 North, part of the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, says other activity consistent with final preparations for a test had been observed on satellite imagery.The saber-rattling comes as Obama wrapped up his South Korean visit. He warned of further sanctions against the North in response to any unsanctioned nuclear test. The test preparations also come as an American tourist was detained by North Korean officials.Preparations for a potential test also act as a backdrop for insulting comments made by the North's Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea about South Korean President Park Geun-hye, which were reported by the North's official KCNA news agency.While the committee is noted for its outlandish rhetoric, the comments are notable for their virulence, including a reference to comfort women, the term used to refer to sex slaves during the Japanese occupation.The vitriolic comments have been condemned by South Korean officials.The live-fire exercises are being taken seriously by the South Korean military."Although the notified regions are located north of the (Northern Limit Line), the South Korean military is taking safety measures for residents, including control of civilian vessels," South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff spokesman Eom Hyo-sik was quoted as saying."The South Korean military told North Korea it will sternly respond if its artillery shells fall on the (South's) side of the NLL."The North engaged in similar exercises at the end of March, which resulted in an exchange of fire between the two neighboring countries.
